# Shopping App

Welcome to the **APIdemo**, a SwiftUI-based project that showcases dynamic product listing, a shopping cart functionality, and favorite tracking. 

---

## Features

- **Home Screen**: Displays a grid of products with dynamic heart icons to mark favorites and cart functionality.
- **Product Preview**: View detailed information about a product, including image, description, rating, and price.
- **Cart Management**: Track products added to the cart and remove them directly from the home screen using the heart icon.
- **Favorites Sync**: Products added to the cart automatically fill the heart icon, making favorites and cart states synchronized.

## Additional Notes and Considerations

### Implementation Details:
- **Favorites and Cart Sync**:
  - The app ensures that any product added to the cart via the preview screen is also marked as a favorite on the home screen.
  - Favorites are tracked using a dictionary (`[Int: Favourite]`), ensuring efficient updates to the heart icon's state.

- **Dynamic Navigation**:
  - The app uses `NavigationLink` to navigate between screens, ensuring seamless transitions.
  - The cart badge dynamically updates based on the number of products in the cart.
